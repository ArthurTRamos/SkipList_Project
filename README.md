# SkipList_Project
This project implements a dictionary in C using ADT (Abstract Data Type) and Skiplists as a data structure
## How it works
First, extract the files, access the directory by the terminal, and run the commands `make` and then `./main`. After doing it, you can use the dictionary with the following operations:

- `insercao word definition`: insert a word with your definition. If it's already in the dictionary, the program returns `OPERACAO INVALIDA`;

- `alteracao word definition`: change the definition of the word. If it's not in the dictionary, the program returns `OPERACAO INVALIDA`;

- `remocao word`: remove the word of the dictionary. If it's not in the dictionary, the program returns `OPERACAO INVALIDA`;

- `busca word`: search for the word in the dictionary. If it's not in the dictionary, the program returns `OPERACAO INVALIDA`;

- `impressao letter`: print all the words that start with the letter. If there aren't any word that start with it, the program returns `NAO HA PALAVRAS INICIADAS POR letter`;

Press `Ctrl + D` or `Ctrl + Z` to finish the program.
